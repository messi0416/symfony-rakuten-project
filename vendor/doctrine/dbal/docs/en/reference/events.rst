Events
======

Both ``Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager`` and
``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` accept an instance of
``Doctrine\Common\EventManager``. The EventManager has a couple of
events inside the DBAL layer that are triggered for the user to
listen to.

PostConnect Event
-----------------

``Doctrine\DBAL\Events::postConnect`` is triggered right after the
connection to the database is established. It allows to specify any
relevant connection specific options and gives access to the
``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` instance that is responsible for the
connection management via an instance of
``Doctrine\DBAL\Event\ConnectionEventArgs`` event arguments
instance.

Doctrine ships with one implementation for the "PostConnect" event:


-  ``Doctrine\DBAL\Event\Listeners\OracleSessionInit`` allows to
   specify any number of Oracle Session related enviroment variables
   that are set right after the connection is established.

You can register events by subscribing them to the ``EventManager``
instance passed to the Connection factory:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $evm = new EventManager();
    $evm->addEventSubscriber(new OracleSessionInit(array(
        'NLS_TIME_FORMAT' => 'HH24:MI:SS',
    )));
    
    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection($connectionParams, null, $evm);
