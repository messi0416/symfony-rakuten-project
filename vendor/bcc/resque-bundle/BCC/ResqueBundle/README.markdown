# Intro to BCCResqueBundle

The BCC resque bundle provides integration of [php-resque](https://github.com/chrisboulton/php-resque/) to Symfony2. It is inspired from resque, a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing them on multiple queues, and processing them later.

## Features:

- Creating a Job, with container access in order to leverage your Symfony services
- Enqueue a Job with parameters on a given queue
- Creating background worker on a given queue
- A UX to monitor your queues, workers and job statuses
- ability to schedule jobs to run at a specific time or after a number of seconds delay
- ability to auto re-queue failed jobs, with back-off strategies

TODOs:
- Log management
- Job status tracking
- Redis configuration
- Localisation
- Tests

## Installation and configuration:

### Requirements

Make sure you have redis installed on your machine: http://redis.io/

### Get the bundle

Add to your `bcc-resque-bundle` to your dependencies:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        ...
        "bcc/resque-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
    ...
}
```

To install, run `php composer.phar [update|install]`.

### Add BCCResqueBundle to your application kernel

``` php
<?php

    // app/AppKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        return array(
            // ...
            new BCC\ResqueBundle\BCCResqueBundle(),
            // ...
        );
    }
```

### Import the routing configuration

Add to your `routing.yml`:

``` yml
# app/config/routing.yml
BCCResqueBundle:
    resource: "@BCCResqueBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml"
    prefix:   /resque
```

You can customize the prefix as you wish.

You can now access the dashboard at this url: `/resque`

To secure the dashboard, you can add the following to your `security.yml` - provided your administrator role is `ROLE_ADMIN`

```yml
    access_control:
        - { path: ^/resque, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }
```

### Optional, secure the dashboard behind a role


Add to your `security.yml`:

``` yml
# app/config/security.yml
access_control:
    - { path: ^/resque, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }
```

Now only users with the role ROLE_ADMIN will be able to access the dashboard at this url: `/resque`

### Optional, set configuration

You may want to add some configuration to your `config.yml`

``` yml
# app/config/config.yml
bcc_resque:
    class: BCC\ResqueBundle\Resque           # the resque class if different from default
    vendor_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../vendor  # the vendor dir if different from default
    prefix: my-resque-prefix                 # optional prefix to separate Resque data per site/app
    redis:
        host: localhost                      # the redis host
        port: 6379                           # the redis port
        database: 1                          # the redis database
    auto_retry: [0, 10, 60]                  # auto retry failed jobs
    worker:
        root_dir: path/to/worker/root        # the root dir of app that run workers (optional)
```

See the [Auto retry](#auto-retry) section for more on how to use `auto_retry`.

Set `worker: root_dir:` in case job fails to run when worker systems are hosted on separate server/dir from the system creating the queue.
When running multiple configured apps for multiple workers, all apps must be able to access by the same root_dir defined in `worker: root_dir`.

### Optional, configure lazy loading

This bundle is prepared for lazy loading in order to make a connection to redis only when its really used. Symfony2 supports that starting with 2.3. To make it work an additional step needs to be done. You need to install a proxy manager to your Symfony2 project. The full documentation for adding the proxy manager can be found in [Symfony2's Lazy Service documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/lazy_services.html).

## Creating a Job

A job is a subclass of the `BCC\ResqueBundle\Job` class. You also can use the `BCC\Resque\ContainerAwareJob` if you need to leverage the container during job execution.
You will be forced to implement the run method that will contain your job logic:

``` php
<?php

namespace My;

use BCC\ResqueBundle\Job;

class MyJob extends Job
{
    public function run($args)
    {
        \file_put_contents($args['file'], $args['content']);
    }
}
```

As you can see you get an $args parameter that is the array of arguments of your Job.

## Adding a job to a queue

You can get the resque service simply by using the container. From your controller you can do:

``` php
<?php

// get resque
$resque = $this->get('bcc_resque.resque');

// create your job
$job = new MyJob();
$job->args = array(
    'file'    => '/tmp/file',
    'content' => 'hello',
);

// enqueue your job
$resque->enqueue($job);
```

## Running a worker on a queue

Executing the following commands will create a work on :
- the `default` queue : `app/console bcc:resque:worker-start default`
- the `q1` and `q2` queue : `app/console bcc:resque:worker-start q1,q2` (separate name with `,`)
- all existing queues : `app/console bcc:resque:worker-start "*"`

You can also run a worker foreground by adding the `--foreground` option;

By default `VERBOSE` environment variable is set when calling php-resque
- `--verbose` option sets `VVERBOSE`
- `--quiet` disables both so no debug output is thrown

See php-resque logging option : https://github.com/chrisboulton/php-resque#logging

## Adding a delayed job to a queue

You can specify that a job is run at a specific time or after a specific delay (in seconds).

From your controller you can do:

``` php
<?php

// get resque
$resque = $this->get('bcc_resque.resque');

// create your job
$job = new MyJob();
$job->args = array(
    'file'    => '/tmp/file',
    'content' => 'hello',
);

// enqueue your job to run at a specific \DateTime or int unix timestamp
$resque->enqueueAt(\DateTime|int $at, $job);

// or

// enqueue your job to run after a number of seconds
$resque->enqueueIn($seconds, $job);

```

You must also run a `scheduledworker`, which is responsible for taking items out of the special delayed queue and putting
them into the originally specified queue.

`app/console bcc:resque:scheduledworker-start`

Stop it later with `app/console bcc:resque:scheduledworker-stop`.

Note that when run in background mode it creates a PID file in 'cache/<environment>/bcc_resque_scheduledworker.pid'. If you
clear your cache while the scheduledworker is running you won't be able to stop it with the `scheduledworker-stop` command.

Alternatively, you can run the scheduledworker in the foreground with the `--foreground` option.

Note also you should only ever have one scheduledworker running, and if the PID file already exists you will have to use
the `--force` option to start a scheduledworker.

## Manage production workers with supervisord

It's probably best to use supervisord (http://supervisord.org) to run the workers in production, rather than re-invent job
spawning, monitoring, stopping and restarting.

Here's a sample conf file

```ini
[program:myapp_phpresque_default]
command = /usr/bin/php /home/sites/myapp/prod/current/vendor/bcc/resque-bundle/BCC/ResqueBundle/bin/resque
user = myusername
environment = APP_INCLUDE='/home/sites/myapp/prod/current/vendor/autoload.php',VERBOSE='1',QUEUE='default'
stopsignal=QUIT

[program:myapp_phpresque_scheduledworker]
command = /usr/bin/php /home/sites/myapp/prod/current/vendor/bcc/resque-bundle/BCC/ResqueBundle/bin/resque-scheduler
user = myusername
environment = APP_INCLUDE='/home/sites/myapp/prod/current/vendor/autoload.php',VERBOSE='1',RESQUE_PHP='/home/sites/myapp/prod/current/vendor/chrisboulton/php-resque/lib/Resque.php'
stopsignal=QUIT

[group:myapp]
programs=myapp_phpresque_default,myapp_phpresque_scheduledworker
```

(If you use a custom Resque prefix, add an extra environment variable: PREFIX='my-resque-prefix')

Then in Capifony you can do

`sudo supervisorctl stop myapp:*` before deploying your app and `sudo supervisorctl start myapp:*` afterwards.

## More features

### Changing the queue

You can change a job queue just by setting the `queue` field of the job:

From within the job:

``` php
<?php

namespace My;

use BCC\ResqueBundle\Job;

class MyJob extends Job
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->queue = 'my_queue';
    }

    public function run($args)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Or from outside the job:

``` php
<?php

// create your job
$job = new MyJob();
$job->queue = 'my_queue';
```

### Access the container from inside your job

Just extend the `ContainerAwareJob`:

``` php
<?php

namespace My;

use BCC\ResqueBundle\ContainerAwareJob;

class MyJob extends ContainerAwareJob
{
    public function run($args)
    {
        $doctrine = $this->getContainer()->getDoctrine();
        ...
    }
}
```

### Stop a worker

Use the `app/console bcc:resque:worker-stop` command.

- No argument will display running workers that you can stop.
- Add a worker id to stop it: `app/console bcc:resque:worker-stop ubuntu:3949:default`
- Add the `--all` option to stop all the workers.


### Auto retry

You can have the bundle auto retry failed jobs by adding `retry strategy` for either a specific job, or for all jobs in general:

The following will allow `Some\Job` to retry 3 times.

* right away
* after a 10 second delay
* after a 60 second delay

```yml
bcc_resque:
    redis:
        ....
    auto_retry:
        Some\Job: [0, 10, 60]
```

Setting strategy for all jobs:

```yml
bcc_resque:
    auto_retry: [0, 10, 60]
```

With default strategy for all but specific jobs:

```yml
bcc_resque:
    auto_retry:
    	default:        [0, 10, 60]
        Some\Job:       [0, 10, 120, 240]
        Some\Other\Job: [10, 30, 120, 600]
```

The `default` strategy (if provided) will be applied to all jobs that does not have a specific strategy attached. If not provided these jobs will not have auto retry.

You can disable `auto_retry` for selected jobs by using an empty array:

```yml
bcc_resque:
    auto_retry:
    	default:        [0, 10, 60]
        Some\Job:       []
        Some\Other\Job: [10, 30, 120, 600]
```

Here `Some\Job` will not have any `auto_retry` attached.

**Please note**

To use the `auto_retry` feature, you must also run the scheduler job:

`app/console bcc:resque:scheduledworker-start`
