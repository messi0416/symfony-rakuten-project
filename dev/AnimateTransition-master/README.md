Animate Transition
===========

Library for transition animations between blocks (pages) in the application.

See live examples:

[Blocks Animation](http://rapid-application-development-js.github.io/AnimateTransition/)

[Popups Animation](http://rapid-application-development-js.github.io/AnimateTransition/popups.html)

---

`Animate Transition` allows you to easily make transition between any two (or more, *it all depends on you* ) HTML elements. It can be used in different variety of situations, whatever you want to enhance appearance of your web site or navigate between pages in hybrid mobile application.

`Animate Transition` provides great performance due to using hardware accelerated CSS transitions. You can choose from 12 preset animation types for blocks, 8 animation types for popups or create your own CSS animation.

`Animate Transition` has no dependencies and supports all modern browsers, including Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, Opera 27+, IE 10+, iOS Safari 6.0+, Android Browser 2.3+

###Advantages

- Unlike other libraries, `Animate Transition` let you not just animate one element, but made a transition between two in a way you like. It also has declarative style and provides callbacks to make sure that your code will be executed in right animation phase.
- In order to prevent interaction with the UI during the transition the whole viewport is covered by the overlay.
- You can create & use your own custom transition animation.

>Is it better than the pure-CSS approach?

>Actually it is the pure-CSS approach in itself - but there is a helper for convenience, which has callbacks in all browsers; animation presets are optimized and work properly; and you write your pure-CSS animation and use it with the helper.

>When there are more then two dozen types of browsers on Android only (let alone adding desktops, iOS, and Windows Phone), very often it becomes a real pain without a helper and optimized CSS.



###Usage

Just include [animateTransition.min.js](https://github.com/Rapid-Application-Development-JS/AnimateTransition/blob/master/src/animateTransition.min.js) and [transitions.css](https://github.com/Rapid-Application-Development-JS/AnimateTransition/blob/master/css/transitions.css)

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="transitions.css"/>`

`<script src="animateTransition.min.js"></script>`

###Methods

#### blocksTransition

	blocksTransition(options)

Takes the object **options** as the parameter. The object has the following properties:

* **container** - container where the animation will take  place. If the property is not defined, by default will be used **document.body**
* **blockIn** - block, to which the transition is carried out. If it is not defined, by **blockOut** the block with the selected animation will disappear from the screen.
* **blockOut** - block, from which the transition is carried out. If it is not defined, by **blockIn** the block with the selected animation will appear.
At least one parameter ( **blockIn** or **blockOut** ) must be specified.
**container**, **blockIn**, **blockOut** can be both css selectors or already existing DOM Elements.
* **animation** - animation name. Currently the following blocks animations are supported by default:
	- `slide-in`
	- `slide-out`
	- `fade-in`
	- `fade-out`
	- `cover-in`
	- `cover-out`
	- `cover-double-in`
	- `cover-double-out`
	- `revolution-in`
	- `revolution-out`
	- `bounce-in`
	- `bounce-out`

	As for showing popups you can choose from 8 animations:

	- `popup-scale-in`
	- `popup-drop-in`
	- `popup-revolution-in`
	- `popup-fade-in`
	- `cover-in`
	- `cover-left-in`
	- `cover-right-in`
	- `bounce-in`

	To hide popup just replace `-in` by `-out`

	- `popup-scale-out`
	- `popup-drop-out`
	- `popup-revolution-out`
	- `popup-fade-out`
	- `cover-out`
	- `cover-left-out`
	- `cover-right-out`
	- `bounce-out`

To create custom animation with `animation_name`, you need to describe following css classes - .transition-`animation_name` for container animation, .`animation_name`-transition-view-to-show for blockIn and .`animation_name`-transition-view-to-hide for blockOut animation.

* `beforeTransition(blockIn, blockOut, container)` - function that will be performed before the transition; if it is set to **false**, the animation will not be performed.
* `onTransitionStart(blockIn, blockOut, container, e)` - function that will be performed at the start of the transition, where **ะต** is the event object.
* `onTransitionEnd(blockIn, blockOut, container, e)` - function that will be performed at the end of the transition, where **ะต** is the event object.

Properties **animation**, **beforeTransition**, **onTransitionStart** and **onTransitionEnd** are optional.



**Examples**


To navigate between two blocks:


```javascript
AnimateTransition({
   container: '.container',
   blockIn: '.newElement',
   blockOut: '.oldElement',
   animation: 'slide-in'
});
```


To show popup:


```javascript
AnimateTransition({
   container: '.container',
   blockIn: '.popup',
   animation: 'popup-scale-in'
});
```


To hide popup:


```javascript
AnimateTransition({
   container: '.container',
   blockOut: '.popup',
   animation: 'popup-scale-out'
});
```
